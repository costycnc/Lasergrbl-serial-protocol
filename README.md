# Lasergrbl-serial-protocol


Attention ... if (cmd[0] == '?')... is not same with ...if (cmd[0] == "?") ... i spend some times until understand mistakes.

<Idle|MPos:0.000,0.000,0.000|FS:0,0>  need to be send with println() , not function with print()

If understand these finally riceived Lasergrbl activated with arrow activated!
